- 👋 Hi, I’m @DY
- 👀 I’m interested in deep learning networks.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Biomedical Engineering degree (Bachelor) 
- 🤷‍♂️ Although there isn't much coding invovled in my degree, I enjoy it, and I will post my codes in here. 
(I learned to code on my own, so I don't know a single thing about optimization or big O's)
